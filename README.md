# Componego Meta Package

This repository collects some third-party packages into one package.
This code is optional. It adds some additional features.

### Why is this package needed?

Some parts of the [framework](https://github.com/componego/componego) may depend on third-party packages. Without this
package, you would be pulling all dependencies into your framework-based component. That is, this package reduces the
number of dependencies in your project.
